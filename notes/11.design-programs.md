# How to Design Your First Programs 

## Steps for Designing a Program

1. Define the Problem → Clearly state what the program should do.

2. Plan the Solution → Break it into smaller tasks (flowcharts, pseudocode).

3. Write the Code → Implement step by step, keeping it simple.

4. Test and Debug → Check for errors and unexpected behavior.

5. Refine and Optimize → Improve efficiency and readability.


## Best Practices and Tips

1. Keep it simple → Start with a basic version, then expand.

2. Use meaningful names → Variables and functions should be descriptive.

3. Write modular code → Use functions to break tasks into smaller parts.

4. Test incrementally → Run and verify each part before adding more.
