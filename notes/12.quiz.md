# Question 1:

Write a single-file program (named main.cpp) that reads two separate integers from the user, adds them together, and then outputs the answer. 

The program should use three functions:

1. A function named “readNumber” should be used to get (and return) a single integer from the user.

2. A function named “writeAnswer” should be used to output the answer. This function should take a single parameter and have no return value.

3. A main() function should be used to glue the above functions together.

---

# Question 2:

Modify the program you wrote in exercise #1 so that readNumber() and writeAnswer() live in a separate file called “io.cpp”. Use a forward declaration to access them from main().

If you’re having problems, make sure “io.cpp” is properly added to your project so it gets compiled.

---

# Question 3:

Modify the program you wrote in #2 so that it uses a header file (named io.h) to access the functions instead of using forward declarations directly in your code (.cpp) files. Make sure your header file uses header guards.
